Next:
- upd_write (HIUPD, HIUPA)


- _prepareCryptSeg()
  - use securityProfile definition structs like in AqHBCI to simplify code
    (see aqhbci/msglayer/msgcrypt_rxh_common.h)

simplify session code like in aqhbci:
- one job per message
    because that's enforced by FinTS anyway
    in most cases especially since VOP
- no need for JobQueues (minus one layer!)
- functions:
  - openDialog()
  - sendJob()
    - can then handle stuff like PSD2, VOP
    - internally used by open/closeDialog()
  - closeDialog()

- jobs:
  - vars:
    - name
    - version
    - requestSegmentName
    - requestSegmentCode
    - responseSegmentName
    - responseSegmentCode
    - bpdSegmentName
    - bpdSegmentCode
    - flags
    - params
    - args
  - functions
    - new()
    - getBpd()
    - getUpd()
  - virtual functions
    - prepare()
    - process()
    - isDone()
      - look for attach points etc
