This folder contains some simple tutorials which introduce possible
developers to AqBanking.


Tutorial1
=========

This just creates an instance of AqBanking, initializes and deinitializes
it.
Nothing fancy.


Tutorial2
=========

This does the same as tutorial1, but in addition it dumps a list of all
accounts AqBanking currently knows of.
It also gives an introduction into the usage of XXX_List2's and list2
iterators.


Tutorial3
=========

This tutorial shows how to use jobs in AqBanking.
In this example we retrieve transaction statements for a given account.
