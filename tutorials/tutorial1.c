/***************************************************************************
 * This tutorial simply creates an instance of AqBanking, initializes and  *
 * deinitializes it.                                                       *
 *                                                                         *
 * You must either choose a GUI implementation to be used with AqBanking   *
 * or create one yourself by implementing the user interface callbacks of  *
 * LibGwenhywfar.                                                          *
 *                                                                         *
 * However, for simplicity reasons we use the console GUI implementation   *
 * which implements these callbacks for you.                               *
 *                                                                         *
 * There are other GUI implementations, e.g. for GTK2, QT3, QT4 and FOX16. *
